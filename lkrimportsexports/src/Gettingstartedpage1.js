        <h5 className="fw-bold gs-que">Which product do you intend to bring into India from China?</h5>
        <p className='gs-text'>
          Importing can be quite simple, but it might be challenging to determine what kinds of things to bring into
          India from China. Before beginning to import from China to India, many of our clients already have a category
          or product in mind. For those who haven't decided yet, there are a few different approaches you can take.
        </p>
        <ul className='gs-points'>
          <strong>01.</strong> Go to China and do the research yourself.
          <br></br>
          <strong>02.</strong> Look up products on the internet.
          <br></br>
          <strong>03.</strong> Go to fairs and commercial exhibits.
          <br></br>
          <strong>04.</strong> The Best Chinese Factories can also make your unique product.
        </ul>
        <p className='gs-text'>
          <strong>Expert Tip: </strong>
          The best products to start with are those that you might readily sell with your current network. Identifying
          the initial product would be the most challenging, but it would be much simpler to refine your selections when
          you had practical experience.

        <h5 className='gs-que1'> How Can I Locate the Best Chinese Supplier? </h5>
        <p className='gs-text'>
        Finding a Chinese supplier is the next step after choosing the goods.  
        Alibaba is the marketplace that most first-time importers visit, although there are other online market portals as well.  
        It's crucial to remember that Alibaba and other marketplaces aren't the real producers of the goods that are advertised on their portals. 
        The suppliers on the list may be manufacturers, distributors, or trade firms.
        </p>
      
        <p className='gs-text'>
          <strong>Expert Tip: </strong>
          Purchasing straight from a factory isn't always the best option. 
          In certain cases, our clients choose trading companies over manufacturers for a variety of reasons, such as higher MOQ, 
          flexibility, delivery time, or more.
        </p>

        <p className='gs-text'>
        It is crucial that you write a formal legal contract as an importer to protect yourself.  
        Often referred to as a supplier agreement, sales contract, production contract, or purchase agreement.  
        For this, consult a lawyer who specialises in commercial law in China.  
        Regretfully, the majority of small importers simply work on a proforma invoice provided by the source and never even consider this.
        </p>

        <p className='gs-text'>
        If there were problems, though, the majority of suppliers would still fix them and safeguard their brand. 
        However, if you intend to purchase a significant quantity from the supplier over time, it is not advised at all and you must obtain a formal legal contract.  
        If you desire IP protection, there are even additional legal requirements.  
        By giving us permission to import from China to India, we can ensure that you adhere to all rules established by our 
        internal staff and simplify the import and procurement process.

        <h5 className='gs-que1'>What is the price of importing goods into India from China? </h5>
        <p className='gs-text'>
        Checking the landing cost is a crucial next step after identifying possible Chinese suppliers and knowing the price.  
        The most crucial factor for the business's profitability is a feasibility analysis.  
        The cost of the goods plus the cost of shipping plus duties and taxes plus other costs incurred to ensure they can be imported can be used to calculate the landed cost.  
        To put it briefly, price includes all expenses from the factory floor to your home.  
        The bottom line profit of your business from importing from China to India is calculated using landed cost.

        <p className='gs-text'>
        You must double-check all of the product specifications and quality requirements after the cost has been determined and you are satisfied to place an order or orders.  
        Informing the manufacturer that they will only accept the goods if they pass inspection or test labs, if appropriate, is also encouraged. 
        Verify that every element is included in the contract that the supplier will sign on your behalf.  
        You can employ our pre-shipment inspection service to have the quantity and quality of the goods checked once they are ready.  
        Once approved, you can either contact a goods moving company or leave the entire process to our experts.

          <strong>Expert Tip: </strong>
          When importing from China to India, cargo insurance is incredibly affordable when you consider the expenses that would arise if your package were to be lost or damaged during transit.

        <p className='gs-text'> <strong>Incoterms</strong>
        <br></br>
        The seller and the buyer must agree in writing on Incoterms, which are (eleven) standardised goods terms, or else the shipment will not be accepted by any air or ocean carrier.  
        For novices, they are a trap, and picking the incorrect one might have disastrous results.  When using Incoterms for the first time, follow:
        </p>
        <ul className='gs-points'>
          <strong>01.</strong> Ex Works (EXW): From factory pickup, you assume complete responsibility for planning, arranging, and paying as well as liable for any issues that arise.  
          Be careful to include a requirement in your purchase agreement that the supplier assist with truck loading. 
          <br></br>
          <strong>02.</strong>  Free To Carrier (FCA): After the shipment is turned over to the carrier, usually close to the port, you assume full obligation and responsibility. 
          <br></br>
          <strong>03.</strong>  Free On Board (FOB): As soon as the shipment passes over the ship's rail, you assume all obligation and responsibility.  
          Between delivery to the carrier and loading into the vessel, local fees should be paid.
