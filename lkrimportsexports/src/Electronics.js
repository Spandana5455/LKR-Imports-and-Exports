        <p className="electronics-body pt-2">Electronic products are constantly in demand in both developed and emerging economies, ranging from smartphones and smartwatches to semiconductors and industrial machinery.
            <br/> The following is a list of popular electrical items that are regularly traded on global markets:
            <br/> Smartphones, computers, tablets, TVs, smartwatches, Bluetooth speakers, and headphones are examples of consumer electronics.
        </p>
        <p className="electronics-body">Home appliances include vacuum cleaners, washing machines, microwaves, refrigerators, and air conditioners. 
            <br/>Semiconductors, printed circuit boards, capacitors, resistors, and transistors are examples of electronic components.
            <br/> Automotive electronics include sensors, navigation systems, EV batteries, and infotainment systems.
            <br/> Industrial electronics include control panels, robotics, automation tools, and circuit testing apparatus.
            <br/>High Demand for Smart Devices: There is a significant increase in demand for IoT-enabled electronics and AI-powered gadgets.</p>
        <p className="electronics-body">Solutions for Sustainability and E-trash: Exporters are concentrating on environmentally responsible production and recycling of electronic trash. 
            <br/>Supply Chain Shifts: As a result of geopolitical tensions and worldwide disruptions, nations are diversifying their supply bases.
        </p>
        <p className="electronics-body">Growth of EV Parts:  The export of lithium-ion batteries, charging devices, and associated technology is being fuelled by the electric vehicle revolution. </p>
        <p className="electronics-body">Among the best-selling goods in international trade are consumer gadgets including wearables, laptops, gaming consoles, and cell phones.  Because of continuing 
            developments, seasonal releases, and changes in lifestyle, these products are always in demand.  In the meantime, there has been a notable increase in the 
            export of household appliances, such as air conditioners, microwaves, and smart refrigerators, especially in developing nations where digital transformation 
            is happening quickly.  Product categories such as printed circuit boards (PCBs), automation devices, and control systems are profitable in 
            business-to-business (B2B) trading because they are vital to many manufacturing and technological sectors.Importers and exporters find electronics to be a 
            particularly appealing industry due to its high value-to-weight ratio, which enables cost-effective transportation.  Since the majority of electronic 
            products are small but have a high market value, shipping them internationally is both practical and profitable.  Furthermore, one of the few products 
            with year-round demand worldwide is electronics, which is fuelled by both retail customers and business businesses.
        </p>
        <p className="electronics-body">Global supply chain issues and changing consumer tastes have caused a shift in trade patterns in recent years.  Leading the way are Internet of Things (IoT) 
            gadgets, smart devices, and electronics with artificial intelligence capabilities.  To cut down on e-waste, nations are also putting more of an emphasis on 
            sustainable practices, advocating for recyclable materials and eco-friendly production techniques.  For traders who specialise in reconditioned gadgets or 
            green-certified goods, this has created new opportunities. Countries that dominate in both manufacturing and exporting, such as China, South Korea, Germany, 
            and the United States, are major participants in the electronics trade.  India, the United States, and a number of European countries are significant importers, 
            largely depending on foreign vendors to satisfy domestic demand.  Successfully navigating these markets necessitates a deep understanding of customs laws, 
            appropriate classification using HS codes, and adherence to certifications such as CE, FCC, and RoHS, depending on the region of destination.   
        </p>
        <p className="electronics-body">With the growing need for technologies that are quicker, smarter, and more connected, foreign traders play an increasingly important role.  Many electronics 
            manufacturers source parts including microchips, sensors, batteries, and display panels from international supply chains.  Importers and exporters serve as 
            the link between producers and markets, guaranteeing the seamless movement of these vital technologies from global production centres to end users. As nations 
            make investments in sustainable energy solutions, the volume of commerce in lithium-ion batteries, EV charging stations, solar inverters, and smart energy meters 
            is rising.  Countries aiming to achieve carbon neutrality are increasing their demand for EV parts and power storage equipment from importers.
