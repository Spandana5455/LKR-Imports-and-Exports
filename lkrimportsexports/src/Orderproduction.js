                    control inspections and are delivered to our warehouse prepared for export, the remaining amount is then paid.  The remaining 70% will be 
                    paid after the goods are received.

                    to give your requirements additional consideration.  Additionally, this gives us negotiating advantage in the future.  We will never make the 
                    remaining payment until the product inspection has verified the quality.
